Scenario: Trade Activities For All accounts From07-09-2014 To07-09-2014
	Given I have the following search criteria for qdf deals
		 | DealSource | DealType     |
		 | cnx-deals  | BookLessDeal |
	When I load cnx trade activities from "C:\data\Trade Activities For All accounts From07-09-2014 To07-09-2014.csv" for the included logins
		And I retrieve the qdf deal data filtered by cnx hub start and end times and by included logins
		And I compare the cnx hub trade deals with the qdf deal data excluding these fields:
		 | ExcludedFields |
		 | Comment        |
		 | AccountGroup   |
		 | Book           |
